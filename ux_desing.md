### Best practices for mobile:
1. Call-to-action buttons should be placed front and center, allowing the user to easily complete the desired task. 
2. Navigation menus should be short and simple. We want to simplify so menu options should only highlight the core functions of the product. 
3. Use gestures that users already do, like tapping and swiping. 
4. Design for both directions a phone might be held. Consider the vertical portrait view of a mobile phone and the horizontal landscape view. 
5. Reduce visual clutter. Mobile phones have smaller screen sizes, so it's important to keep the visual experience simple.
